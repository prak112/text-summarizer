# Background
Information overload is no surprise in this era of information dumping through blogs, social networks, websites, media, & what-nots.</br></br>
For addressing and automating my day-to-day activity of capturing the gist of an article, news or basically just general information about my favourite cartoon character, I want to build a text-summarizer.</br></br>
Hoping to develop a text-summarizer from scratch and bit-by-bit grow this little endeavour to better understand the techniques used to enhance natural language analytics.</br></br> 
Eventually, in a possible future project, wish to develop a personal assistant for myself (a friendly assistant like Jarvis, hopefully! :D)</br></br></br> 


# Aim
 To build different levels of text summarizers from basic to complex, whilst understanding the process of natural language analysis for the purpose of developing a personal assitant in the future.</br></br></br>
